Automatic table and date search:

Create a basic HTML web page or use the index.html file provided. Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. Make sure you have columns for date/time, city, state, country, shape and comment. Use a date form and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
